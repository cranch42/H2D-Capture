# H2D Capture

Browser extension that captures any webpage and lets you paste it directly into a Figma canvas — preserving layout, styles, images, and text as editable Figma layers.

**HTML to Design, one click away.**

## How it works

1. Click the extension icon on any webpage
2. Choose **Entire screen** or **Select element**
3. The page is captured to your clipboard
4. Switch to Figma and press `Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V` — done

The extension walks the DOM tree, computes a style diff against browser defaults, resolves images (including cross-origin), infers Auto Layout sizing hints, and serializes everything into Figma's clipboard format.

## Features

- **Full-page capture** — captures the entire scrollable page, not just the viewport
- **Element selection** — pick a specific component to capture
- **Auto Layout hints** — infers FILL / HUG / FIXED sizing for every element so Figma can build responsive Auto Layout frames
- **Flex & grid support** — preserves flex direction, alignment, gap, and grid structure
- **Cross-origin images** — multi-strategy fetch: canvas rasterization, same-origin fetch, and a CORS bridge through the extension's background service worker
- **SVG inlining** — computed styles are baked into SVG elements for accurate rendering
- **Font detection** — probes which fonts are actually rendered on the page
- **React component annotations** — detects React Fiber tree and annotates captured nodes with component names and source locations
- **Lazy image loading** — forces lazy images to load before capture
- **Infinite scroll protection** — caps page scroll-through at 15,000px / 25 steps
- **Draggable toolbar** — minimal, non-intrusive UI rendered in a Shadow DOM

## Install

### Chrome / Edge / Brave / Arc

1. Download the latest `h2d-capture-chrome-vX.X.X.zip` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Unzip it
3. Go to `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder

### Firefox

1. Download the latest `h2d-capture-firefox-vX.X.X.zip` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on** and select the zip file

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cranch42/H2D-Capture.git
cd H2D-Capture
npm install
npm run build
```

Load `dist/chrome/` or `dist/firefox/` as described above.

To build and create zip archives:

```sh
npm run build:zip
# Output:
#   dist/h2d-capture-chrome-v1.5.0.zip
#   dist/h2d-capture-firefox-v1.5.0.zip
```

## Architecture

The extension is split into two layers:

### Capture library (`src/lib/`)

Framework-agnostic DOM processing engine. No browser extension APIs, no UI. Handles:

- DOM tree walking with visibility checks and pruning
- CSS style diff computation against browser defaults
- Layout sizing inference (FILL / HUG / FIXED) for Auto Layout
- Multi-strategy image resolution with CORS fallbacks
- SVG style inlining and font probing
- CSS transform math and bounding rect computation
- React Fiber tree introspection
- JSON serialization and clipboard encoding

### Extension shell (`src/extension/`)

Browser-specific integration layer:

- **Manifest V3** — minimal permissions (`activeTab`, `scripting`)
- **Service worker** — script injection, CORS bridge for cross-origin image fetch
- **Toolbar** — Shadow DOM UI with element picker, status messages, drag support
- **Firefox support** — `injector.ts` bridges the MAIN world injection gap via `<script>` tags

### Communication flow

The extension uses a three-world message bridge:

```
MAIN world                  ISOLATED world              Background
(capture.js, toolbar.js)    (CORS bridge)               (service worker)
        |                         |                          |
        |--- CustomEvent -------->|                          |
        |                         |--- runtime.sendMessage ->|
        |                         |                          |-- fetch(url)
        |                         |<-- sendResponse ---------|
        |<-- CustomEvent ---------|                          |
```

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Bundle to `dist/{chrome,firefox}` |
| `npm run build:zip` | Build + create zip archives |
| `npm run build:chrome` | Chrome build only |
| `npm run build:firefox` | Firefox build only |
| `npm run watch` | Rebuild on file changes |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript type checking (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| `npm test` | Run unit tests (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Build + run Playwright E2E tests |

## Tech stack

- **TypeScript** — strict mode, ES2020 target
- **esbuild** — fast bundling, IIFE output (unminified for readability)
- **Vitest** — unit tests
- **Playwright** — E2E tests

## Local files

To capture local HTML files (`file://` URLs), enable file access for the extension:

**Chrome:** `chrome://extensions` → H2D Capture → Details → toggle "Allow access to file URLs"
